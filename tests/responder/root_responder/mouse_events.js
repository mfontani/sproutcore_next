/*
  We call RootResponder's browser event handlers directly with fake browser events. These
  tests are to prove RootResponder's downstream behavior.
  
  Our test pane has a view tree like so:

  pane
   |--view1
   |  |--view1a
   |  |--view1b
   |--view2

  Simulating responder-chain events on view1a allows us to ensure that view1 also receives
  the event, but that view1b and view2 do not.
