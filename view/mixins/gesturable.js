  You can mix in Gesturable to your views to add some support for recognizing gestures.

  SproutCore views have built-in touch events. However, sometimes you may want
  to recognize gestures like tap, pinch, swipe, etc. This becomes tedious if you
  need to do this often, and more so if you need to check for multiple possible
  gestures on the same view.

  Gesturable allows you to define a collection of gestures (Gesture objects)
  that your view should recognize. When a gesture is recognized, methods will be
  called on the view:

    - [gestureName](gesture, args...): called when the gesture has occurred. This is
      useful for event-style gestures, where you aren't interested in when it starts or
      ends, but just that it has occurred. SwipeGesture triggers this after the
      swipe has moved a minimum amount—40px by default.
    - [gestureName]Start(gesture, args...): called when the gesture is first recognized.
      For instance, a swipe gesture may be recognized after the finger has moved a
      minimum distance in a horizontal.
    - [gestureName]Changed(gesture, args...): called when some property of the gesture
      has changed. For instance, this may be called continuously as the user swipes as
      the swipe's distance changes.
    - [gestureName]Cancelled(gesture, args...): called when a gesture, for one reason
      or another, is no longer recognized. For instance, a horizontal swipe gesture
      could cancel if the user moves too far in a vertical direction.
    - [gestureName]End(gesture, args...): called when a gesture ends. A swipe would end
      when the user lifts their finger.

  Each of these methods is passed the gesture instance, in addition to any arguments
  the gesture sends for your convenience. The default swipe gesture sends an Touch
  instance, the swipe direction, and the distance the swipe has moved in that direction.

  Using Gesturable
  -------------------

  To make your view recognize gestures, mix in Gesturable and add items to the 'gestures'
  property:

      View.extend(Gesturable, {
        gestures: [PinchGesture, 'mySwipeGesture'],

        // specifying as a string allows you to configure it:
        mySwipeGesture: SwipeGesture.extend({
          direction: SWIPE_VERTICAL,
          startDistance: 3,
          swipeDistance: 20
        }),

        // handle the swipe action
        swipe: function(touch, direction) {
          console.error("Swiped! In direction: " + direction);
        },

        swipeStart: function(touch, direction, delta) {
          console.error("Swipe started in direction: " + direction + "; dist: " + delta);
        },

        swipeChanged: function(touch, direction, delta) {
          console.error("Swipe continued in direction: " + direction + "; dist: " + delta);
        },

        swipeEnd: function(touch, direction, delta) {
          console.error("Completed swipe in direction: " + direction + "; dist: " + delta);
        }

      })

    The gestures that the view will support. This property must be set on the consumer of
    `Gesturable` before it is initialized.

    These gestures should be objects that extend the `Gesture` class. You can use SproutCore's
    pre-built gestures or create your own. If you create your own, you can use a property name
    in the list of gestures to refer to the actual gesture class, similar to how the childViews
    array works. For example,

        gestures: [PinchGesture, 'mySwipeGesture'],

        // Specifying the Gesture by property name allows you to configure it.
        mySwipeGesture: SwipeGesture.extend({
          direction: SWIPE_VERTICAL,
          startDistance: 3,
          swipeDistance: 20
        }),

    Note that `gestures` is a *concatenated property*, which means that it will not be overwritten
    by subclasses. So for example, if the base class lists gestures as `[PinchGesture]` and its
    subclass lists gestures as `[TapGesture]`, the actual gestures supported by the subclass will
    be `[PinchGesture, TapGesture]`.
