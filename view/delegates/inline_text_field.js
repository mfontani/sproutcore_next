  This is the default InlineEditorDelegate for LabelView. The default editor
  is an InlineTextFieldView.

  Only one editor is allowed to be active at a time. If another view requests an
  editor while an editor is already active, the delegate will first attempt to
  commit the existing editor, then discard it if commit fails, and fail to
  acquire if the active editor could not be discarded.

  Each time an editor is required, it instantiates it and appends it to the same
  parentView as the view being edited. The editor is responsible for positioning
  itself correctly in its beginEditing method.
