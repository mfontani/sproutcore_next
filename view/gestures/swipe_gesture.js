/**
  ## What is a "swipe"?

  A swipe is one or more quick unidirectionally moving touches that end abruptly. By this, it is
  meant that at some point the touches begin to move quickly, `swipeVelocity` in a single direction,
  `angles`, and cover a fair amount of distance, `swipeDistance`, before ending.

  The single direction that the touches move in, must follow one of the angles specified in the
  `angles` array. However, the touches do not need to precisely match an angle and may vary by
  an amount above or below the angle as defined by the `tolerance` property.

  Because the swipe is the last moment of the touch session, the swipe gesture is always interested
  in a touch session. As long as the last distance traveled is great enough and at an
  approved angle, then a swipe will trigger.

    The angles that the swipe will accept, between 0° and ±180°. The angles start from the right
    side (0°) and end at the left side (±180°). With the positive angles passing through *down*
    (+90°) and the negative angles passing through *up* (-90°). The following ASCII art shows the
    directions of the angles,


                        -90° (up)
                          |
                          |
        (left) ± 180° --------- 0° (right)
                          |
                          |
                 (down) +90°

    To make this easier, there are several predefined angles arrays that you can use,

    * SWIPE_HORIZONTAL ([180, 0]), i.e. left or right
    * SWIPE_VERTICAL ([-90, 90]), i.e. up or down
    * SWIPE_ANY (null), i.e. 0° to up, down, left or right
    * SWIPE_LEFT ([180]), i.e. left only
    * SWIPE_RIGHT ([0]), i.e. right only
    * SWIPE_UP ([-90]), i.e. up only
    * SWIPE_DOWN ([90]), down only

    However, you can provide any combination of angles that you want. For example, to support
    45° angled swipes to the right and straight swipes to the left, we would use,

       angles: [180, -45, 45] // 180° straight left, -45° up & right, 45° down & right

    ## How to use the angles.

    When the `swipe` event fires, the angle of the swipe is passed to your view allowing you to
    recognize which of the supported angles matched the swipe.

    Note, there is one special case, as defined by `SWIPE_ANY`, which is to set angles to `null`
    in order to support swipes in *any* direction. The code will look for a swipe (unidirectional
    fast motion) in any direction and pass the observed angle to the `swipe` handler.
