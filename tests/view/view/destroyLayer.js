/**
  There is a bug that if childView layers are rendered when the parentView's
  layer is created, the `layer` property on the childView will not be
  cached.  What occurs is that if the childView is removed from the parent
  view without ever having its `layer` requested, then when it comes time
  to destroy the layer of the childView, it will get('layer'), which had a
  bug that only returned a layer if the view has a parent view.  However,
  since the child was removed from the parent first and then destroyed, it
  no longer has a parent view and would return undefined for its `layer`.

  This left elements in the DOM.

  UPDATE:  The addition of the View statechart prevents this from happening.
