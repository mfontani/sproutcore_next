  ## What is a "tap"?

  A tap is a touch that starts and ends in a short amount of time without moving along either axis.
  A tap may consist of more than one touch, provided that the touches start and end together. The time
  allowed for touches to start and end together is defined by `touchUnityDelay`.
  Again, to be considered a tap, there should be very little movement of any touches on either axis
  while still touching. The amount of movement allowed is defined by `tapWiggle`.
