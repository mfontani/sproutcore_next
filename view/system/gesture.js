  @class

  An Gesture analyzes Touch objects and determines if they are part
  of a gesture. If they are, Gestures keep the views that own them up-to-date
  as that gesture progresses, informing it when it starts, when some aspect of
  it changes, when it ends, and—for convenience—when it is considered to have
  been "triggered".

  Gestures can call the following methods on their views:

  - [gestureName](args...): called when the gesture has occurred. This is
    useful for event-style gestures, where you aren't interested in when it starts or
    ends, but just that it has occurred. SwipeGesture triggers this after the
    swipe has moved a minimum amount—40px by default.

  - [gestureName]Start(args...): called when the gesture is first recognized.
    For instance, a swipe gesture may be recognized after the finger has moved a
    minimum distance in a horizontal.

  - [gestureName]Changed(args...): called when some property of the gesture
    has changed. For instance, this may be called continuously as the user swipes as
    the swipe's distance changes.

  - [gestureName]Cancelled(args...): called when a gesture, for one reason
    or another, is no longer recognized. For instance, a horizontal swipe gesture
    could cancel if the user moves too far in a vertical direction.

  - [gestureName]End(args...): called when a gesture ends. A swipe would end
    when the user lifts their finger.

  Gesture Lifecycle
  ------------------------
  Gestures start receiving events when their view—usually mixing in Gesturable—tells it
  about activities with "unassigned" touches. "Unassigned" touches are touches that have
  not _yet_ been assigned to a gesture.

  The touch becomes "assigned" when the gesture's touchIsInGesture method returns true.
  When a touch is assigned to a gesture, the gesture becomes the touch's touch responder;
  this means that it will receive a touchStart event (to which it must return true), and
  then, all further touch events will be sent _directly_ to the gesture—the gesture's view
  will not receive them at all.

  At any point, the gesture may tell the view that it has started, ended, or changed. In
  addition, the gesture may tell the view it has been "triggered." A gesture is not
  necessarily "triggered" when it starts and ends; for instance, a swipe gesture might
  only be triggered if the swipe moves more than a specified amount. The ability to track
  when the gesture has been triggered allows views to easily handle the gesture as its own
  event, rather than as the individual events that are part of it.

  If, at some point, the gesture must release the touch back (perhaps the gesture had _thought_
  the touch was a part of it, but turned out to be incorrect), the release(touch) method releases
  it back to the view.

  Exclusivity
  ---------------------------------
  The concept described above gives the gestures a way to be either exclusive or inclusive as-needed:
  they can choose to take exclusive control of a touch if they think it is theirs, but if they are
  not sure, they can wait and see.

  Status Object
  ---------------------------------
  It is a common need to track some data related to the touch, but without modifying the touch itself.
  Gesture is able to keep track of simple hashes for you, mapping them to the Touch object,
  so that you can maintain some state related to the touch.

  For instance, you could set status.failed in touchesDragged, if a touch that you previously
  thought may have been part of the gesture turned out not to be, and then check for
  status.failed in touchIsInGesture, returning false if present. This would cause the touch
  to never be considered for your gesture again.

  touchIsInGesture is called with the status hash provided in the second argument. You may look
  up the status hash for a touch at any time by calling this.statusForTouch(touch).


  Implementing a Gesture
  ---------------------------------
  To write a gesture, you would generally implement the following methods:

  - touchIsInGesture: Return true when the touch is—or is likely enough to be that you
    want your gesture to have exclusive control over the touch. You usually do not
    perform much gesture logic here—instead, you save it for touchStart, which will
    get called after you return true from this method.

  - touchStart: Return true to accept control of the touch. If you do not return true,
    your gesture will not receive touchesDragged nor touchEnd events. At this point,
    you may (or may not) wish to tell the view that the gesture has started by using the
    start(args...) method.

  - touchesDragged: Use this as you would use it in an View to track the touches
    assigned to the gesture. At this point, you might want to tell the view that the
    gesture has updated by using the change(args...) method.

  - touchEnd: Again, use this like you would in an View to track when touches
    assigned to the gesture have ended. This is also a potential time to alert the view
    that the gesture has ended, by using the end(args...) method. Further, this may
    also be the time to "trigger" the gesture.
